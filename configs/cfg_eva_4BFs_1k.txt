| com stands for the combination of properties for matching. Here, the numbers in the left of “->” is are character lengths, and the number in the right is the weight of this combination. For example, “3 0 6 -> 1” means the combination contain 3 characters of 1st property, 6 characters of 3rd property, and the weight is 1. Note, if the character number of the property is “S”, this property will be encoded by soundex method.
